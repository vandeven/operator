# Credits

This is a fork of the controller made in the bootiful controller workshop which can be found here https://github.com/tiffanyfay/bootiful-kubernetes-operators-workshop

# Purpose

This adds an integration test to the controller where it starts up a k3s testcontainer, configures the application to talk to the testcointainer and then starts up the application.
